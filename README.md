## Back-End (Part 2):
In this part we were asked to create:
-Reviews list page where you can add, edit and remove reviews (Reviews-WebApp).
-API backend that allows the front end to work with it (Messenger-WebAPI project).
-Add SignalR, which adds real time commucation support (HubForProject project).
-Fix the front end website to work with API and SignalR (web-app project).

### How to run:
For the reviews website, it is a standalone app. So all it is needed is to open Reviews-WebApp project, and run it (which will start the browser and open a browser with the website).

For the rest of the project, you will need to:
- Download/Clone this repo, and get into /part-2.
- Like in Part 1, get to web-app folder and run npm install, and afterward run npm start.
- Open Messenger-WebAPI project and run it. It will open a server and a browser with an API testing website (ignore it but don't close it).
- Open HubForProject prject and run it. It will open a server and a browser with demo website (ignore it but don't close it).
- Notice: no users made beforehand, so create your own when testing.

## Front-End (Part 1):
We were asked to make a chat application using React, and Bootstrap.
the backend is hardcoded for now, and is running in client side for this part.
Our chat application has support for:
- login and register users.
- send messages with text or with files (audio, video or image).
- support viewing files in application, in a popup.

We used those packages in this part:
- [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
