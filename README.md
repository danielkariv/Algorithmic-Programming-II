## Front-End (Part 1):
We were asked to make a chat application using React, and Bootstrap.
the backend is hardcoded for now, and is running in client side for this part.
Our chat application has support for:
- login and register users.
- send messages with text or with files (audio, video or image).
- support viewing files in application, in a popup.

We used those packages in this part:
- [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
